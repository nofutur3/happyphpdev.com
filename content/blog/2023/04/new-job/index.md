For the past few years, I've been working as a contractor for several clients. Although I knew I would have work for the next few months, the tasks were becoming repetitive and not particularly challenging. I realized I had fallen into a comfort zone, which can be a dangerous spot to be in.

I asked myself what would David Goggins do? And the answer was that I don`t know. He would probably stay hard while running shitload of miles. 

Joining the project has been a roller coaster of emotions. At first, I was hesitant to take on such a big challenge and had doubts about my ability to keep up. But I'm glad I pushed myself out of my comfort zone and took the opportunity.

It's been tough, but I'm learning so much and enjoying the experience of working with such a talented team. And who knows, maybe now that I'm taking on new challenges and expanding my skills, I'll even have some time to write a few articles for this site!
